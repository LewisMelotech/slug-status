"""The Minecraft commands that load a script on the server.

The server's datapack names its functions after each script's custom id, so the id is
the whole of what varies — and a script without one has no command to give. Every custom
id is already a valid function path: slugs.SLUG_PATTERN only accepts lowercase letters,
digits and single hyphens, and Minecraft allows all of those.

The Discord bot builds the same two commands in its own ``botcbot/minecraft.py``. Change
one and change the other, or the site and the bot will hand out different commands.
